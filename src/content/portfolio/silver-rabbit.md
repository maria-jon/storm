The core of Storm Philippa Clarén's art is color, patterns and shiny surfaces. Storm describes herself as a magpie that is drawn to everything that glitters, whether it is silk fabrics or a glazed porcelain clay. 

Her style is intentionally naive, and through her work, she embraces a bold and eclectic aesthetic.⁠
